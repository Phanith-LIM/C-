A number is a palindrome if its reversal is the same as itself. An even palindrome number is a number 
which is even and also a palindrome. Write a program that displays the first 50  positive even 
palindrome numbers ten per line.
Output:<br>
```{r}
0       2       4       6       8       22      44      66      88      202
